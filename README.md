Home automation system with Arduino, XBee and Sensors

Home Automation System prototype using Arduino Uno®, XBee® and different sensors and components. This prototype is compounded of two Arduino’s one of them (called the controller) have a LCD and a remote controller that allows you to select different commands which are sent using XBee wireless communication to the other Arduino (called the operator) where the sensors and components are connected. The operator contains a sun light sensor that turn on a LED on night, an infrared sensor used to detect smoke and activate an alarm, a variable dim LED and lastly a LED that can be turned on/off. The main aim of this project is testing and researching about the use of different sensor and wireless communications.
